# REU-2023--Amanda--Metamaterials
Designing novel metamaterials structures and applying them to medical devices.
Metamaterials describe a class of engineered materials that leverage structural patterns found in many different found materials. These patterns, or unit cell structures, include grid, lattice, honeycomb structures, etc. Computational design tools allow us to customize metamaterials to satisfy different aesthetic and functional concerns. Researchers in this space aim to understand how different cell structures behave and their ability to be fabricated using different digital fabrication techniques.
Exploratory Questions- 
How might we expand the space of available unit cells by drawing from organic or bio-inspired structures found in nature?
What are the properties of bio-inspired unit cells (BIUC)?
How might digital fabrication techniques be leveraged to manufacture metamaterials with BIUCs?
How might BUIC metamaterials be designed to support health monitoring or wearable applications?
